I cannot stand unix/linux and all the "C"-like languages, e.g. JavaScript, C++, etc. with all their gobbly-gook special character shite.  To me all things that revolve around unix/linux pretty much suck and are garbage for geeks.  Remember, geeks by defintion in history were those who would bite the head off a live animal in public.  Why would anyone want to be associated with anything regarding geeks, or worse want to call themselves geeks?
